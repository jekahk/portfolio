# Portfolio | jekahk.com

My portfolio page. The purpose was to create a site that has information about me and my projects. Also I wanted to concentrate on the design of the page.

The page is coded using React.js with couple of small libraries: [react-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll), [Particles-bg](https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg) and [react-typical](https://github.com/catalinmiron/react-typical).
